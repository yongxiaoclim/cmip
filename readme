This Repository includes a series of code to apply weighting CMIP6 data. Method used in Liang et al. 2020, GRL (submitted).
The weighting method is based on some previous study. Knutti et al. 2017, GRL, Lorenz et al. 2017, JGR and Brunner et al. 2019, ERL. 

The function of this repository

1. Data preparation  
2. Weight CMIP6 models to constrain the future warming
3. Evaluate weighting method by imperfect model test and probabilistic validation method
4. Projection by weighting method compared with unweighted results

The calculation setup

1. Calculate diagnostics for targeted metric for preparation (trend, global gridded near-surface temperature)
2. Make evaluation on targeted diagnostic, e.g based on correlations for historical diagnostic and future warming.
3. Calculate distance matrix, e.g. trend difference between all models and all models and obs and RMSE between all models and all models and obs, can use code here
4. Calculate optimal sigma values. 
   For sigma_d values in our cases, since σ_D varies between future periods for each SSP, we use different σ_D over different periods when computing weights for 
   projection. 
   For sigma_s, we calculate metrics using a range of sigma values for denominator of weighting equation by historical simulations.
5. Use sigma values and distance matrix (model-model) to make evaluation by imperfect model test and probabilistic validation, which can use code here
6. Make projection by distance matrix (model-obs) to make projection
